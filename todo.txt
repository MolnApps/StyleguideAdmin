Implementation
— Create a StyleguideLoader object
— Move the responsibility of loading the Pageables for a Page from the ComponentResolver to individual *Editor.vue classes
— When I add a Text page (so no qualified component editor is shown), add the new page to the store and reset PageSteps component.
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
