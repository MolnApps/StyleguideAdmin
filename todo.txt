Implementation
— Allow to choose a page type and component when creating a page
—— Inject props to component after the page was saved
—— Use store for all libraries
——— Colours
——— Typefaces
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
- We should ask for confirmation before deleting an item from the library.
— Differentiate between feedback types (success, error, notice, etc.)

— Bugs
—— If I click Editor Save Changes without any resource, an error will be thrown.
——— LogoEditor

——— TypographyEditor
—— MoodboardEditor: 
——— Only one image will be added to the list.
