Implementation
— this.$store.getter('module/byPageSlug') calls should always be in computed properties.
- Refactor feedback to use Bus.js
— When I add a Text page (so no qualified component editor is shown), add the new page to the store and reset PageSteps component.
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
