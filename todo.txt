Implementation
— Allow to choose a page type and component when creating a page
- All buttons that perform an Ajax Request should display a loading icon when clicked
— Colour Palette Editor: I should be able to edit/remove colours in the library.
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page


— Bugs
—— Need to refactor url generator (now 'undefined' is appended to the string)
—— Index
——— Reordering index throws a 500 internal error in api call
——— Toggling a chapter works, toggling a nested child does not.
——— Removing a page will be persisted, but a 500 internal error api call is triggered
—— When I add/remove contacts from a person, reactivity is lost.
—— When I add a contact to a new person, an error is thrown because contacts is not an array.
—— Person Form: display feedback after save
—— Person Form: a new contact will not be added or updated
—— We should not create a new listener on every request
—— MoodboardEditor: 
——— Only one image will be added to the list. 
——— Only two out of three images will be saved to the DB.
——— Provide feedback after successful response
—— Typeface Editor: typeface will not be associated with page.
—— TypefaceForm: 
——— typeface will be updated, but the new record returned by the api is not set in the form.
——— provide feedback after successful response
—— LogoForm: update fails, probably because no file is selected.
—— LogoSpecsForm: the form data is reset but not with the record returned by api.
