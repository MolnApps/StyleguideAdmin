Implementation
- Make feedback disappears through a new 'Feedback' component that has a setTimeout function.
— Allow to choose a page type and component when creating a page
—— We should display qualified component after the page was created (possibly programmatically)
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
- We should ask for confirmation before deleting an item from the library.


— Bugs
—— MoodboardEditor: 
——— Only one image will be added to the list. 
——— Only two out of three images will be saved to the DB.
