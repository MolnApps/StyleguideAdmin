Implementation
— I cannot upload a logo from LogoEditor > Add New Logo.
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
- We should ask for confirmation before deleting an item from the library.
— Differentiate between feedback types (success, error, notice, etc.)
— TypefaceFamilyForm: onSuccess should return just the record, not the whole data structure.

— Bugs
—— If I click Editor Save Changes without any resource, an error will be thrown.

——— Only one image will be added to the list.
