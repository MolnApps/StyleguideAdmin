Implementation
— Allow to choose a page type and component when creating a page
—— When adding a page to the index, we should display the PageSteps component, not the page component.
—— If the page has no components, ask the user where to put the page in the index. Then reload the styleguide.
—— Inject props to component after the page was saved
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page
- We should ask for confirmation before deleting an item from the library.
— Differentiate between feedback types (success, error, notice, etc.)

— Bugs
—— IndexEditor: If I add a page and then click on SaveChanges button, an error will be thrown.
—— If I click Editor Save Changes without any resource, an error will be thrown.
——— LogoEditor
——— ColourPaletteEditor
——— TypographyEditor
—— MoodboardEditor: 
——— Only one image will be added to the list. 
——— Only two out of three images will be saved to the DB.
