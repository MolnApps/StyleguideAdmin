Implementation
— Allow to choose a page type and component when creating a page
—— Styling
— LogoForm: File upload update
- All buttons that perform an Ajax Request should display a loading icon when clicked
— Colour Palette Editor: I should be able to edit/remove colours in the library.
- When the user removes a page with children from the index, ask where to append the children of the deleted page


— Bugs
—— MoodboardEditor: 
——— Only one image will be added to the list. 
——— Only two out of three images will be saved to the DB.
